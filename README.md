# GitHub Learn 📚

This repository is a personal documentation of my journey learning **Git** and **GitHub** — from the very basics to more advanced workflows. It contains practice exercises, notes, and experiments to strengthen my understanding and prepare me for real-world usage.

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand core Git concepts (version control, repository, commit, branch, merge, etc.)
- Get comfortable using GitHub for collaboration and project hosting
- Build fluency in using Git via the command line
- Maintain structured notes and practical examples for future reference

📌 Why Use Branches?

  Isolate features or fixes

  Enable teamwork on different parts of a project

  Experiment without breaking the main project
